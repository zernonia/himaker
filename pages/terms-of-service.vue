    <h3>Use of Account &amp; Property Rights</h3>
    <p>
      You’re responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your account, even if someone else accesses it.

      and enter.

      questionable. You must ensure that your content is not obscene and does not contain material that is harmful or
      inappropriate to persons under the age of 18.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reserve our right to delete your content or permanently / temporarily terminate your account without prior

      to our service. We will not be liable for any consequences of the loss of content or termination of your account.
    </p>
    <p>
